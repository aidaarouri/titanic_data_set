Insights on Age_group and Survival rates:

Raw number of Survived among different age groups:
Among the 891 individuals in the dataset, I observed the following number of survivors in each age group:
  * Kids (0-16 years old): 100 individuals
  * Adults (16-55 years old): 574 individuals
  * Elders (55+ years old): 40 individuals

Relation between age groups and survival rates (relative to the entire sample):
When considering the entire sample, I find the following survival rates for each age group:
  * Kids (0-16 years old): 55.00%
  * Adults (16-55 years old): 38.85%
  * Elders (55+ years old): 30.00%

Relation between age groups and survival rates (relative to each age group):
When examining the survival rates within each age group, I find the following insights:
  * Among kids, approximately 11.22% of individuals survived.
  * For adults, a significantly higher proportion, about 64.42%, managed to survive.
  * In contrast, the elder group had a survival rate of approximately 4.49%.

These findings indicate a notable discrepancy in survival rates between age groups. Children and adults had significantly higher chances of surviving compared to elders. This may be attributed to various factors.
